# This project is the result of a test task for Netris
This project is a web application with the following functionality:
● Display test video with pause and resume option playback by clicking on the video area;
● Displaying a list of analytics events with the ability to position the video at the moment specified in the event;
● The list of events must be sorted by date of occurrence, the event itself must displayed in the list
  as the time of its occurrence in the format MM: SS: sss (minutes: seconds: milliseconds). 
  Example: 00: 03: 012, 01: 05: 123, 03: 26: 100
● When an event occurs in the player, a green rectangle should be drawn over the video,
  corresponding to the area defined in the event. The rectangle should be displayed as if
  transition to an event by clicking from the list of events, as well as in the case of normal playback and
  video navigation. When the end date of the event comes, the rectangle should be hidden.
  It is possible that 2 or more rectangles are shown at the same time.
